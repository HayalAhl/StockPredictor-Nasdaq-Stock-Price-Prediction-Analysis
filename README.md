## Description

**StockPredictor** is a data science project focused on analyzing the historical stock data from the Nasdaq stock exchange, with the main goal of predicting future stock prices. The project utilizes various Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **XGBoost**. By leveraging the power of machine learning, the aim is to predict stock price movements, which can be helpful for investors to make informed decisions.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze historical stock price movements and extract meaningful patterns.
- Predict future stock prices using supervised machine learning models.
- Visualize the market trends and price movements effectively.
- Implement and optimize machine learning models like **XGBoost** for accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Import and preprocess historical stock data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create interactive and static visualizations of stock price trends, correlations, and returns.
- **Prediction Model**: Apply **XGBoost** to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use interactive widgets to fine-tune the modelâ€™s parameters and improve prediction accuracy.

## Visualizations

The visualizations are a key part of this project, helping to understand stock market trends and behavior. Some key visualizations include:

1. **Stock Price Trends**: A line plot showing the historical stock prices of selected companies.
   - Created using **matplotlib** to visualize the daily fluctuations in stock prices over a given period.
   
2. **Return Distribution**: Histograms of daily returns to assess stock volatility.
   - This helps in visualizing the spread and frequency of stock price changes.

3. **Correlation Heatmap**: A heatmap showing correlations between different Nasdaq stocks.
   - This allows for understanding how various stocks in the market move in relation to each other.

4. **Prediction vs Real**: A plot comparing predicted stock prices against the actual prices to evaluate model performance.
   - Visualize how accurately the model predicts stock prices by comparing them with historical data.

## Stock Price Prediction

The main goal of this project is to predict the future prices of Nasdaq-listed stocks based on past performance and other relevant factors. The dataset includes features like the closing price, trading volume, and technical indicators (e.g., moving averages).

### Techniques Used:
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that is utilized to predict stock prices based on historical data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Alongside predictions, the project also involves analyzing market trends and behavior through statistical metrics.

By leveraging machine learning, the goal is to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease, providing valuable insights for investors.
